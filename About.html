      <p>
        My main interests include gameplay mechanics, vehicle physics, UI/UX design for games, 
        and building smooth, responsive interactions. I enjoy creating systems that feel good 
        to control—whether it’s a drifting mechanic, a HUD layout, or a clean web interface.

        <h3>Featured Project: 3D Drifting Game</h3>
        <p>
          A physics-focused drifting game built in Unity. I developed custom handling, traction 
          tuning, scoring systems, and UI elements such as speed, RPM, and drift score feedback. 
          This project strengthened my skills in gameplay loops, physics behavior, and clean, 
          responsive UI design inside a 3D environment.

        <h3>Additional Web & Interface Work</h3>
        <p>
          Outside of game development, I build accessible front-end interfaces using HTML, CSS, 
          and UX-driven design principles. I use Figma for prototyping and plan layouts 
          intentionally to support clarity and usability.
